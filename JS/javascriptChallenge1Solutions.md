JavaScript Challenge #1 Solution - Part 1

Writing the pseudocode for Rock, Paper, Scissors...

What are the rules for Rock, Paper, Scissors?

1. Two players: User & Computer
2. Each player chooses rock, paper or scissors.
3. Winner is decided by these rules
  * Rock beats Scissors
  * Scissors beats Paper
  * Paper beats Rock
4. If players choose the same thing, it's a tie.

My pseudocode:

1. Player #1 (the user) will select rock, paper, scissors. This will trigger the computer to randomly select rock, paper, scissors.

2. Compare the two choices to see who wins (check for tie first).

3. Display message on who won.
