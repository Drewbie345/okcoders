JavaScript Functions
====================

The Fortune Teller
------------------

1. Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

  * Write a function named tellFortune that:
    * takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
    * outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
  * Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

The Age Calculator
------------------

2. Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

  * Write a function named calculateAge that:
    * takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
    * calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
    * outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
  * Call the function three times with different sets of values.
  * Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in. 

The Lifetime Supply Calculator
------------------------------

3. Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

  * Write a function named calculateSupply that:
    * takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
    * calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
    * outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
  * Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
  * Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

The Geometrizer
---------------

4. Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.

  * Create a function called calcCircumfrence:
    * Pass the radius to the function.
    * Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
    * Create a function called calcArea:

    * Pass the radius to the function.
    * Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
