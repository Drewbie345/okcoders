The Fortune Teller
------------------

1. Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

  * Write a function named tellFortune that:
    * takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
    * outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
  * Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.
